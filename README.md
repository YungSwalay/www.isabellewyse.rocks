Merry Christmas Isabelle!

## So what did Uncle Charlie actually get me for Chistmas this year?
A domain name is a way for other people to easily get things that you've
made from places that you put them on the internet.  It's (kind of) like an address for
your webpage!

Now, if you want to make a webpage (maybe with some help from Mom and/or Dad), 
you can share it with your friends, family, or whoever you want, 
just by telling them what they already know, "isabellewyse.rocks"!

## That's cool and all Uncle Charlie, but how does my webpage work?
Well, when you type your domain name into Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
(please don't use Edge or Internet Explorer kids!) it turns that name into
an IP address (extra points if you've heard of those!).  Then it uses that
IP address to get the webpage from another computer on the internet.  It says,
"Hey other computer with this address, Isabelle Wyse wants to see your web page!"
and so the other computer says, "Okay, here you go!" and sends back a bunch of text
just like you are reading now.

And that's because all webpages are is just text written in very a special way!  That's
how we code the whole internet!  So all the code that Uncle Charlie used to make your card can
be found and viewed in this public GitHub repository.  Take a look through it and see if 
you can see what it's doing.  I might even be able to show you how to change it to say what you
want!

So now if you've read this far, have your Mom or Dad text me the following code for
the rest of your christmas present...9f32de
